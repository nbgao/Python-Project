here's one I used recently to snag a file before it was deleted: " inotifywait -e CLOSE_NOWRITE,CLOSE dhclient6-${IF}.conf; cp dhclient6-${IF}.conf /tmp/ "
how do i run this: node-v4.4.2-linux-x64.tar.xz
tar what?
is there a something that can be used in place of network manager
what do you want to do?
if you really really really want to do a 3rd party code install, then read the readme/howto on the page you got that from
tar -ZxfJ I think
i get these errors NetworkManagererror requesting auth for org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wifi.share.protected: (3) GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner: Could not get UID of name ':1.25': no such name
k1l, oh so how do i install node...
which ubuntu release?
14.0.4
!info nodejs | django_
nodejs (source: nodejs): evented I/O for V8 javascript. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.10.25~dfsg2-2ubuntu1 (wily), package size 672 kB, installed size 3094 kB
I need version 4
thats not version 4
give me a moment whilst I look at the 14.04 code
if you are ok with a slightly messy install, you can just do tar -xf on it, copy it to /opt/, and add the bin folder to your path.
OK, that looks like the result of a bug in NetworkManager. the "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wifi.share.protected" is a PolicyKit name for authorising actions. It looks as if NM is mis-using it as a DBus name, which reports it cannot find it
is it preventing you from connecting to the WiFi network?
no its not
i just want too fix it
it's classed as a "<warn>" so it's none fatal. As best as I can see it was fixed in later versions of Network Manager
ok
clear

anyone point me to an example udev rule to have bluray, dvd, and cd all automount in a bluray drive?
!upgrade
For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
enabling automount in X makes blurays automount, but i have to explicity mount dvd's, adding the drive to fstab makes dvds automount but doesn't seem to work for bluray
I just installed sublime-text using their .deb package, it is installed, I can run it, but it's not listed on ubuntu software center
how can I remove it?
sudo rm -rf /opt
sudo apt remove sublime-text   (or whatever that package name is for sublime)
any idea why it's not showing on ubuntu software center?
i dont know. try apt on a terminal
is mailing list for personal specific case help?
that removed, thanks
but it's still weird it's not showing on software center
you can ask here for ubuntu support
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-users  this is for technical support
looks like Ubuntu software center is being replaced in 16.04 with gnome software center
i mean is that for case specific help?
what do you mean?
what is the mail list for if you can ask via here and/or forum?
that would be awesome, really
think most people (at least I can speak for myself) have just been using apt-get at the terminal like k1l said since it tends to be faster and more obvious if something goes wrong what needs to be done
ubuntu software center never looked that well
yeah hopefully is better I actually run gnome but not sure that I've used that version of the software manager yet
if you want to ask in the irc (in here) you dont need a mailinglist. just ask your technical support question
i mean what is it for since anyone can ask?
I see, I knew about the apt-get remove, but I got curious about the behavior of the software center, I didn't expect I wouldn't be able to uninstall it from there

When one upgrades from 15.10 to 16.04 are all your necessary kernel modules preserved automatically?
So hardware support is preserved....
personally have been using clementine https://www.clementine-player.org/ says it has ipod support but I just use it for streaming podcasts mostly
ubuntu uses dkms to build kernel modules. so yes, they will work on the new release if that supports the kernel in use
thanks kindly!
with dkms it can cause build failures against the new kernel, if the source code of the out-of-tree module uses some facility the new kernel has changed
I see, TJ - aren't most kernel upgrades backward compatible, though?
TJ in such a case, would it improve one's chances of compatibility if one just did a fresh install instead of upgrade?
the issue is that out-of-tree modules often use fragile constructs, but also that the mainline kernel's internal interfaces aren't fixed so a newer kernel could change things and of course the out-of-tree module doesn't keep in step - if the DKMS module comes from the Ubuntu archive you *should* be OK since the new release will be updated, but third-party DKMS modules can break
I see....
we had an issue like that with nvidia for the 15.10 release, where a function Nvidia relied upon had its signature changed
The reason I ask, TJ- is that I have bleeding edge hardware. Everything is working now, but I worry about the coming upgrade....
I need to report a bug in 16.04 and I don't know the package that it relates to. When I wake 16.04 from suspend, I experience a double log in screen.
you can always install the Wily kernel .deb files and test them
I'm on Wily right now. What do you mean?
hahah I meant Xenial, 16.04
Had someone yesterday installed the 16.04 kernel packages in 15.10 to fix a missing driver issue
which deb files do you mean, the linux sources and firmware packages?
What if they don't work, could I easily downgrade to the old versions?
Is anyone aware of a way in inhibit screensaver/sleep/suspend/etc when the screen is locked  ...  Modifying the power settings, brightness & lock settings, and even running caffeine all only seem to inhibit these within the user's desktop.  Once the screen is locked (CTRL+ALT-L or Super+L), within about 15 the Unity Greeter is already dimming and going to sleep.
it's just added into the GRUB menu so you can always boot from an older kernel, and then remove the 16.04 kernel
something like this to fetch/install: "mkdir /tmp/kernel; pushd /tmp/kernel; wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-headers-4.4.0-17_4.4.0-17.33_all.deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-{image,image-extra,headers}-4.4.0-17-generic_4.4.0-17.33_amd64.deb; dpk -Ri . ; popd "
so this would only be possible through the archives, not the software desktop application?
right, because you need the 16.04 kernels and you don't want to risk pulling in anything else
OK, one thing what is that command you wrote dpk - Ri?
it installs all .deb files in the named directory. By creating a dir and fetching the files into it, it avoids having to pass the filenames to 'dpkg -i'
So the command is dpkg -Ri? Is that correct?
no, it is "dpkg -Ri ." there is a 'dot' there, meaning 'this directory'
the commands as I gave them are 100% accurate
when running a command line application (scrapy) with a newly pulled version of code, it is still running an old version..why???
got it. Thank you!
what do you mean by 'newly pulled'
just pulled from a repo
right, and has that over-written the previous version?
yeah
so any new executions of the same file will be the new version
files have been deleted as well,
for some reason it's running old code / potentially old files too
this is so ridiculous
this has nothing to do with replacing files
this has to do with cache or something
Are you trying to over-ride an Ubuntu package?
no
i know why up time is down time sometimes, cause, some time its up/baz, the other time baz/up, lolo
its python code
tried to get qnswers there
well, if you've replaced an older file with newer, then the old version has gone
wow thanks

and fan not blowing
i have to use only intel driver
cpu getting hot
I've looked high and low
can't find a fix
in software / additional driver it lists and Unknown: Unknown
this device is not working
which one do you prefer?
now i use the 352.63 proprietary
my sdcard is mounted as /media/username/sdcard. was this always the case or did previous verisons of ubuntu use /media/sdcard
I think I recall that it may have changed. But now I would expect it to be /media/username/sdcard
udisks handles it and it goes to /media/$USER/$LABEL-or-$UUID
older releases - 12.04 I think - manually mounted under /media/ using udev rules I think
thanks

how to get client mac address for my security server
anyone have a sample config for bluray and dvd automounting ?
you mean you want the Ethernet MAC of the system's interface(s)? "ip link show"
hey
no no

sorry, I only cook for people I know :)
i cant figure out why my windows entry wont boot
what do you mean then?
TJ- i know my mac address i want know the mac address of clients for to make a lists of ip-macaddress of my clients if I detect abuss i ban for my server
is it an UEFI system with mixed boot modes?
"ip neigh show"
i think so
if you've got Windows installed in UEFI boot mode, and GRUB in legacy BIOS mode, you won't be able to use GRUB to boot Windows. If GRUB is installed in UEFI mode then it can do it via calling back into the system's UEFI code
ip neigh show?
how do i know
Does Windows have an entry in the System's UEFI boot menu? if so, then it's UEFI mode.
i dunno
I dunno how that stuff works
can I check that using fdisk?
if the boot disk has an EFI system partition you can check in that. EFI CP is a FAT file-system, usually the first partition, and usually about 500MB in size
i know why up time is down time sometimes, cause, some time its up/baz, the other time baz/up, lolo

Any advantages security-wise installing edubuntu over reg Ubuntu in a school environment? (ESL)
rustuptwist__, more preinstalled software for the kidz I suspect. never used it, but they are not getting updated to 14.04
I know nothing about edubuntu, but it does look like they're building it on 14.04  https://www.edubuntu.org/news/14.04-release
ok. I'm just putting on Ubuntu cause the kids have manged to break windows. How or what to do to lock down computers so they can't mess with settings?
i think i'm challenged when it comes to cron (and maybe everything computers).  trying to run a simple script which works fine until you set it up as a cron job.  i get "/home/ubuntu/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.3/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require': cannot load such file -- mysql (LoadError)" when i run it via cron instead of seeing normal script output.  any ideas?
somsip, I mistyped. I meant, they're not updatign to 16.04. they're staying on 14.04
probably environment not correctly set, as here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13462447/cron-job-cant-load-gem
fair enough
rustuptwist__, I think you force them to sign on in a non admin account? idk to be sure
HA!  thank you somsip!  i thought it was environment related but couldn't realy get any further.

hello, I just reinstalled my old 14.04 with a brand new 14.04, wireless (ath9k) is now limited at 11Mbps using usual environment. I could track down the problem to one detail, before reinstall kernel was 3.19.*, after clean install(and "apt-get dist-upgrade") the kernel is a 4.*. Configuration is default in both cases. Can someone point me in the right direction please? I heard of a kernel
bisection, should I do that?
a bisect lets you compile your own kernel and then you do a binary search through all the changesets by compiling/testing in a loop all the time
it is unlikely what you want
hello cpaelzer, actually yes, i suspect some regression
it is a lot of work to do, and you would need to build the Ubuntu kernel
are you familiar with compiling custom kernels?
yes i do
ah fine
but i was wondering if there would be some known problem regarding the ath9k (atheros wireless) driver and the 4.* series kernel in ubuntu
just making a clean install and alternating between the newest 3.* and the earliest 4.* kernels shows the wifi bitrate locks at 11Mbps in b/g/n mode.
and all on 14.04 - that means you switch between hwe-vivid and hwe-wily (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack)
hum, you are right, both kernels are inapropriate for that release :/
no both are :-)
is it supposed to break the wifi though?
the release gets out with an initial version, but then with every subsequent Ubuntu release the LTS versions get an updated HWE kernel
so you should be totally in a good environemnt
it shouldn't be "supposed to" :-), but then I'm not at all an expert in WiFi things - I'll try to look through bugs ....
i was a bit lost by the choices offered by apt, this indeed seemed like an updated kernel (4.4) thanks for the clarifiaction, now i know they all are useable.
supposing i have some spare time and ressources available, would a bisecting the kernel be the good approach considering the symptoms?
if it is really "triggered" just by switching between those two kernels in the boot menu and nothing else AND you have some spare time it is an option
after seacrhing for open/known issues - just to be sure
only thing google could dig out was for unstable connexions and fluctuating speeds and boiled down to loading the kernel module with an option to disable hardware encryption offloading
it didn't fix the thing, and yes just switching kernels on a default install triggers the problem
never did that after the howto, but the rough outline looks like a good guid https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection
since you said you are known to custom kernels I tihnk you can fill in the gaps
i seems my next few nights will be busy sorting out commits then haha :)
make sure you look through https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux?field.searchtext=ath9k&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch=&field.has_

that was bad, let me make a shortlink

welcome, how can we help you?
does anyone know why apt-get update shows ubuntu-device-flash needs to be updated, but it keeps holding it back?
when i enter apt-get dist-upgrade it just does nothing
did you add ppa's of any kind? manual installs?
could that have something to do with the installation of the the ubuntu sdk for developing ubuntu touch apps?
did you add external ppa's of any kind?
not that i know of @lotuspsychje
wich ubuntu version are you on?
14.04

hmm
can you check your /etc/apt/sourcues.list or in software&updates
*sources
check if there are external ppa's added there
do you want me to copy it hhere lotuspsychje? i'll check it now
if you pastebin sure, we take a look

To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
oh, i'll go and install that then

thx cfhowlett ;)
Any idea why I can't play webms in firefox on wily?
codecs installed? perhaps ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
no driver plugin, N3X15
lotuspsychje, thank you, will report back when apt is done stumbling around.
hmm how do i find the name of the ppa related with the files in sources?
installed ppa-purge, but i need to figure out what the ppa's are called
well officially we cant support ppa's mate
maybe apt-cache show package can show wich?
or apt-cache policy package
the problem is i dont know what to type for package :P i don't know what the package is called when i want to remove it
sources.d shows openshot, but that doesn't seem to be on my system anymore
this is why i would recommend to purge all external, non official ppa's from system
!sources | vancha these are official
vancha these are official: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources for the recommended way to set up your repositories.
i want to lotuspsychje, but  i don't know the names of the unofficial ppa's :(
lotuspsychje, nope, installed without errors, still getting "failed to decode".
Doesn't seem to matter whether VP8 or VP9
And the same webms open on Windows build of the same version of Firefox without issue.
N3X15, in your ffox browser         about:config             then search for webm
All enabled
specifically?

And if you check, those are all set to true on mine, as well.
I just have an additional bunch of settings for flashgot, which is an addon.
I see you have some custom settings --- I suspect your stream has been redirected to a different plugin.  test: disable those user sets or try a different webm site
flashgot doesn't redirect those streams, though.  I even disabled it entirely.
As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by CenturyLink: flashgot doesn't redirect those streams, though.  I even disabled it entirely.
Is there a way to hide the administrator log in and have an automatic log-in for a standard account?
Also can I update eduB 12.04 LTS via the Terminal?
rustuptwist, yes
first sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
then sudo do-release-upgrade
BUT your system upgrader must be set to LTS releases only
I'm looking for just essentials if possible
no idea what you mean
I'm in a school environment with slow connection so if there is a way to just update core system as opposed to everything.
rustuptwist, then torrent the .iso and do an off-line upgrade.  it will take a bit of time so be patient.  in fact, you might wait a few weeks and get 16.04 instead of 14.04
is it safe to jump over LTS versions? just curious don't know one way or another
"safe"?
you cannot sudo do -release-upgrade more than a single LTS at a time
I just installed 12.04 if there is no security need to update to 14 then I don't have to
rustuptwist, why you not install 14.04???
I'm just an Ubuntu enthusiast taking advantage of the fact that windows is fried on the computers so doing a side by side install with Ubuntu.
yeah just meant can you do an upgrade install from 12 to 16 or do you upgrade to 14 then upgrade to 16
wafflejock, nope.  incremental upgrade still applies.  12.04 > 14.04 > 16.04             but that may have been invisibly changed.  lots of reports that you could directly upgrade from 12.X to 15.10
Not able to confirm that last
hello
guys I've a query about syslog file permissions
I'm not in the US, net speed is slow, computers were 100% inoperable, had a edubuntu 12 disc w/my stuff from the states, etc.,
ah k just curious since that will probably be coming up pretty soon here :) off to bed for now though
rustuptwist, have one more year of support with 12.04.  14.04 is the latest LTS so you should have gone with that
makes sense
syslog can create files in /var/log (files named syslog.gz, syslog.gz1 etc), but only root has got write access on /var folder. How syslog does that..?
I figured I could use terminal to update to 14. Just need a rapid update if possible cause once I leave the lab, who knows what can and will happen, lol
rustuptwist, and that is why you should install the latest available LTS
ok. How do i know if sys updrader is set to LTS releases?
FYI before i instsalled thrre was no linux/ubuntu running just windows
settings > system > software updater > settings > updates > Notify me of a new ubuntu version: For LTS versions
Dont see thst in sys setting (edubuntu 12) i do see an update manager folder on desktop
tested other browsers then FF?
lotuspsychje, not yet.
perhaps try with chromium-browser see what it does?
!upgrade | rustuptwist
For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
i got sudo apt: command not found
doh!  right.
rustuptwist, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sorry for misinformation.  apt is slowly rolling out to replace apt-get
but all things considered, you're still better off doing the torrent > install method rather than a hot upgrade
ok I have 14 on Usb I just had edubuntu cd and since it is a school after all I thought I'd put eduB on at least 1 unit to try it
lotuspsychje, works on Chromium
rustuptwist, install 14.04 then install the edubuntu-desktop.  logout, select edubuntu session, login = edubuntu!
perhaps flash related then?
lotuspsychje, Firefox plays webms natively.  From what I can tell via bughunting, this may be an issue caused by gstreamer-0.10-ffmpeg getting removed
ah
reinstall then?
It's gone from the repo
wich ubuntu version?

gstreamer-1.0-libav is supposed to fix it, but firefox isn't compiled against 1.0 in upstream yet
and I don't feel masochistic enough to set up their horrifying buildsystem tonight
hmm, apt-cache shows a whole bunch of it, not sure whats the replacement
Oh well, Chromium it is, for now.
Thank you, lotuspsychje
perhaps a firefox purge, and reinstall will do the right dependecies also?
also sure your up to date to latest?
lotuspsychje, Yep, just did an apt-get update an hour ago.  I'll try blowing out firefox tomorrow.
good luck, if you found it solved, plz come tell us
N3X15, I too am curious.
cfhowlett, lotuspsychje, still not working after purge and reinstall.
haven't been able to replicate the problem so can't advise further
http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/tests/video.html is the page I used, for the record.  the ogg and mp4 play fine.
plays like a charm here
Trying with a fresh profile.
thanks for that link! bookmarked
Yeah, still failing, even with a fresh ~/.mozilla/firefox
I'm going to blame firefox's gstreamer support and call it a day.
can you doublecheck lsb_release -a

Hi.
Has anyone here tried to install the openstack single server?
Hyllegaard, please do not use "has anyone else" question structure.  waste of time.  post YOUR issues with YOUR information
Ok :) Sorry about that.
My problem is that having just installed ubuntu and the openstack single server, I am not able to reach any of the ip's listed in the openstack status.
Hyllegaard, I suspect the #ubuntu-server channel would know more ...
cfhowlett, lotuspsychje, #firefox got me to try a nightly mozilla build and it works fine.
So looks like an issue with ffmpeg, prehaps.
too weird N3X15.  but yeah there is still significant confusion with ffmpeg/avconv
bug mentions libav-tools update fixes issues
Yeah, but the question is when that'll roll down the hill into the stable pool. :P
i wonder if a fresh install would solve your issue...

is it possible to remove unity from ubuntu and install Xfce as a default DE??
yes but not usually advise.
just install xubuntu-desktop and chose that instead. Tricky to cleanly remove unity AIUI
*advised.
why ? what is the problem to remove unity?
angel96, xubuntu-desktop will grab the whole xubuntu experience.  sounds like you want only the DE.  sudo apt-get install xfce4^
lots of dependencies. To "cleanly" remove it is fiddly
angel96, unity is heavily integrated into ubuntu.  breakage is almost guaranteed
eg, theis is out of date I think: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexubuntu
install xfce4, logout, choose xfce session, login
very much out of date
yup - just example though
if it's paramount to you, install from minimal and then install xfce cleanly on top of that
ok.. thanks

about displaying a message "Banner /path/to/file"

I guess you can have a banner show prior to login, but not in the manner of "You were denied SSH access"?
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | while read u;do usermod -s /usr/local/bin/hello_there $u;done
Banner will display a message before the loginprompt, /etc/motd to display a message after login
what a faggot you are
that's right, but it looks like he was asking for a message output on access denied, which I suppose isn't available
saw that now =) No idea about "block message"... =(

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get -y install python2.7
t_, first you must add the ppa
oh, I see
That should install python 2.7.11. However python is still showing as version 2.7.6?
what is the output of "lsb_release -d"?
is it possible to preload a .so for all exe's in a system?

it doesnt offer 2.7 at all for 14.04: https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/ubuntu/deadsnakes?field.series_filter=trusty
so better remove that PPA with ppa-purge again
t_, python 3 will be standard on 16.04.  why do you muck about with 2.7?
Is there somewhere else I can get the latest version of 2.7? I'm stuck w/ it for a pre-existing app

ok
because something is going wrong
What?
a filesystem is in an inconsistent state
What can i do?
do you have a live usb? try to run fsck on it
Silverdragon, as stated, a fsck is required.
your filesystem on your harddisk is damaged. you need to run a live-ubuntu and check that
\quit
\q
exit
quit
OK i try it
It is not working :(
And now?
what isn't working?
When i Start ubuntu starts the busy box i checked for defects and it wasn't Wirkung
did you boot a live usb and run fsck?
Fsck?
yes
filesystem check
How can i run it
boot a live usb and run sudo fsck /dev/sda1
Ther is only that http://imgur.com/zua69NK

Hi. I have an installed package marked as "broken". Can I somehow manually mark it "not broken"? (missing dependency packages, installed with dpkg --ignore-depends=...)
true
how do i ensure the keyboard map layout is the one i wish ?
type sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999
i use the top right indicator but it doesnt improve

The problem is, if I try to install / update anything, I get "package broken, do apt-get -f install", which then wants to remove it (after which I of course have to install it again etc.)
ok, type sudo fsck -f /dev/sda1
why does it want to install it agaian?
It doesn't, but I do
I would rather "not remove it", but apt-get wants to
why does it want to remove it?

press y
http://pastebin.com/3ve9x98J
basically press y to everything unless it seems drastic i guess
I have installed asound2:i386, ia32-libs is, of course, no longer installable, unless I use some old repos
ok, try to install the aforementioned packages it depends on and see what it says
http://imgur.com/szF74Vf
On Ubuntu 16.04 btw, but I assume the solution (manually marking package as "not broken" should be probably same for any version)
maybe there's a different teamviewer ppa? /join #ubuntu+1 for 16.04 support
y
Like I said, I have a "generic" problem, that a package is marked "broken". I don't care if ubuntu think it's broken or not, I want to prevent it from being uninstalled every time I do some installation & upgrades
And I specifically need to use this old version for nwo
I don't think this is related to ubuntu 16.04 specifically, or teamviewer at all
your "generic" problem is due to the ppa telling apt that it depends on that package, which isn't a part of ubuntu anymore
Sure, the "why it's broken" is, but I just want to "bypass" it
Well, that's one problem, but not the one I'm trying to solve
http://imgur.com/o7wRT9s
you mean workaround?
You could say that too
that sounds like you are trying to make the most dirty workaround not look dirty
if you want apt to ignore a dependency you'd have to rebuild the package yourself and remove the "Depends" in the control file
try to reboot
What I mean, is there some apt-something / dpkg-something with some --mark-not-broken=<packages> command
but either there was a big issue with a crash or powershortage, or the hdd is broken
OK
Of course the program seems to work ok (although not used too much yet, better try to make it so, it won't be uninstalled at each turn first)
Its Wirkung THX
i dont htink there is an ignore switch for broken states
Jupp3, 1. sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386  2. sudo apt-get update  3. sudo apt-get install gdebi  4. sudo gdebi your_teamviwer_version.deb
Working *
Anyway, got it working
anyone got a script for batch shrinking PDF files?
This is NOT recommended, but posting this workaround anyway: http://www.sudo-juice.com/ignore-broken-packages-ubuntu-aptitude/
okay, this is frustrating. I have a laptop with 14.04 and I just recently started using GNOME Classic (3) instead of GNOME Flashback (the old 2.x interface). ever since then I have had the laptop quit responding after blanking the screen *at least* twice
Just would have expected that if I tell dpkg to ignore dependencies, it would be ignored for good
and I have zero useful diagnostic information. I have looked everywhere to try to find log entries that hint at the cause and no joy.
you are messing with your packagesystem. more issues are to be expected
you're playing with fire and begging to get burned.
Sure, definitely true, but doing that for a package, that no other should depend on, should be relatively safe
Sure, but uninstall is no option for me for now
Of course I'd want to get rid of that for good, but for now, I need it
Just posted the workaround as reference, with recommendation to NOT do it :)
I have had to uninstall and reinstall to fix package problems before. (especially in the case of running out of disk space things can go really bad really fast)
And I agree that doing that for some library would be way more dangerous
even with a recommendation to not do it, it's still dangerous advice and a bad idea to post
Well, of course I could have simply removed & reinstalled that each time I need to update / install something, but that would get bothersome after a while, and no guarantee if settings will be preserved etc.
it's kind of like those leaflets the Mexican government gives to people trying to expatriate to the US. they devote three pages to saying "legal is the best way" and 29 to saying how to do it illegally
Didn't paste it as "advice"
if you don't purge your configs will stick around
what program is it?
Teamviewer 8
That's how it SHOULD go. I'd never absolutely trust that to work on a random old closed source program though :)
what was the workaround?
this is why I don't pollute my nice free software OS with non-free, binary-only software :-)
I'd rather do that aswell, but sometimes you just can't avoid id
hello Im trying to install ubuntu but i think my laptop hard drive is not working anymore
is there any command to check if it detects it or something?
what makes you think the hard drive is not working?
if you choose 'try ubuntu' you can use gnome-disks to see harddisks
Anyway, for YOUR problem, I think I've seen exactly similar behavior (system getting stuck at black screen after screensaver gets triggered)
when i click install ubuntu it does not show a disk or something
Probably not as old as your ubuntu was back then
this is on 14.04 LTS
how risky is it to install the last 16.04 LTS prerelease at this point?
and how easy is it to upgrade to the real 16.04 when it is out?
open a terminal and run "sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999" show the link here
The bad news is, I don't 100% remember what was the thing causing it, I think it was some x lockscreen something... If I killed that, the system was usable again
if you need to ask dont run alpha/beta
To be honest, I found kubuntu 16.04 way more stable than 15.04 and 15.10 were for me
But there's always a risk
in my case, it was a hard lockup. laptop did not suspend on closing the lid. hooking up wired connection got nothing. trying to ssh in on laptop using wifi IP got nothing.
I'd install "next" version only, if I find some "too serious" issues in current version
laptop was D-E-A-D dead with only power light and wifi light on
my goal is to stay on LTS
Or if I just want to test it, being prepared to reinstall if it breaks
Ok, different then... For me, the screen stayed black, but I could ssh in
I could clone my install to an external hard drive and use that
Don't remember if virtual consoles worked

<k1l> so how h iT? i check my email wit
<k1l> so how can i check my email with it?
install mutt, do the config, run it.
you want it, so invest 10 minutes of reading and set it up :)
google told me that https://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/04/14/learning-the-mutt-mail-client/
<k1l>hummm my language is week but tnx
<raub> tnx again my friend
if you are going to use yahoo, it has a way to give a separate long weird password to be used with clients

Hi, i'm using 14.04.4 on x86_64 system. When I try to install *steam*. I get a libGL.so.1 missing error. Also I have broken dependency for libgl-mesa-glx:i386
what should I do. 32bit packages seem to be missing
I cannot share a screen shot because I 've uninstalled them
I've manually upgraded to 4.2kernel and latest mesa and xorg
that might be the issue
I upgraded from 14.04.1

It's trying to fetch the url https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo/dists/ubuntu-trusty/Contents-amd64.gz but the correct url is https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo/dists/ubuntu-trusty/main/Contents-amd64.gz
Can someone tell me what's wrong and how I can fix it, please?
hmm
Hi, it's possible to install and run Ubuntu on Zotac NEN Steam Machine like any other desktop pc?
Yes. SteamOS is just Debian
hateball perfect . I am going to buy one to use it as a Ubuntu desktop pc. Thank you! :)
You could most likely get better hardware for less if you built/bought a non-steam machine
But to each their own
hateball reviews say that it is very silent. As I want a very silent desktop it looks a good choice
bye
If you ask over in ##hardware they may have recommendations for a silent desktop computer that doesnt cost as much as a steam machine
hateball ok I will do, thank you again :)
But of course you do as you like. It just seems strange to me is all :)
waste of money
hateball ok :))
how can i ADD my EMAIL to MUTT program?
!mutt | reza_sam
mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix operating systems. For more Informations on how to setup see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/mutt and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mutt
hey. i've got a sytem set up with windows 10 and arch with grub already installed. i want to install ubuntu as a third thing. can i figure out what ubuntu would put in grub's config and add it to /boot/grub in the arch partition?
you need to invest some minutes to get to know how to setup mutt. if you have specific issues then ask specific questions.
best case is you run "sudo update-grub" on the OS that you want to handle the grub and that will see all other OS installed and put that into the grub autmatically
how do i tell ubuntu's installer to not touch the boot sector or efivars?
k1l> just i have problem for adding email...just it...if  u say to me is very good
if you want an easy way to use your email: use thunderbird or another GUI program that got assistants for setting it up.
but you want a cli email program. they dont have assistants for settings that up. so you need to read the documentation and then make the settings yourself.
so if you dont want to read about it and just want an easy email program: use thunderbird.
GUys, i've installation proccess seems stuck. i can't use apt-get install cuz of it..
is there anyway to know what's the proccess id ?
to kill it
<k1l>So i think i need to red some document :)
the bot gave you the links already
RegulationD yeah tnx
what's stuck? press ctrl+c
I'm installing it via Ubuntu Software Center. andit said some other libs required. and stuck there
Like i see the icon is active. but can't open window
even in "Software center" => "proccess" i can't cancle them by clicking on 'X'
Oh cancelled :D
cool
So, I tried installing the latest (15.10) ubuntu this morning, and I've had wireless problems with Debian in the past but was always able to resolve them with the iwlwifi-6000 firmware, it seems that ubuntu as the latest version(6) of this preinstalled, but I still cannot connect to my network....
Has anyone successfully connected with an intel ultimate n 6300 here before, on  15.10?
I've installed the 16.04 beta2 as an upgrade from 14.04. I run Ubuntu with i3wm (tiling window manager). Can anyone please tell me why now when I run unity-control-center most icons from there are gone?
I'm running unity-settings-daemon via i3 startup btw
hello, i have a problems with flash player in chromium, I`m using ubuntu 16.04.maybe someone can help me?
??
#ubuntu+1 fo 16.04 as long as its not released
~_~
hey, i know this has nothing to do with ubuntu, but is there anyone thats good with portforwarding that can pm me?
hi guys short question / im searching a performance toolbar or something like that for ubuntu
you mean a system monitor in the panel?
hi
im trying to install wine but the install button on the software centre is blanked out
hello?
open a terminal "sudo apt install wine"
ok
Hey, I'm running Xubuntu 15.10 and I'm considering upgrading to 16.04. I don't mind a few bugs here and there I just want my system to still work (although I do have a backup). With all these things in mind, how stable is the current status of the final beta?
its still unstable. if you need to ask dont use alpha/betas. :)
ok, i tried that but it just comes up with a load of erors
errors
Fair enough, when it's finally released will their be performance improvements?
paste them to paste.ubuntu.com and show the link
ok
depends :)  but it will ship a new kernel and new version of packages. so it might be better
Hey, Does anyone know if it is safe, to have mount and edit data on a disk, lets say /dev/sdb, that is exported as iscsi device and is mounted on another host? I mean does iscsi support a protocol for coherency (like NFS)?
bonjour
hello
Ummh hello people, I'm looking for PDF editor. and good one. does anyone suggest?
spmething
 I use Okular for highlighting and commenting pdfs
no, it isn't safe. iSCSI is a SAN protocol, which is block, not file level
katerina, highlighting?  what do u mean?
I've found Master PDF Editor quite useful. It was originally a paid-for application in the Ubuntu App Store but has been free for a while now (if I recall correctly)
TJ-, Do u have any link for it. to read about it
katerina, seems PDF reader. not editor.
viewer  *
Yes you cannot edit text if that is what you want.
see https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/
Hey, i disabled icmp with ufw (ufw default allow outgoing), can this cause my ipv6 routes to be lost after the ttl expires ?
TJ-, Thanks )) seems good one
ehhh * ufw default deny outgoing
Yes; if you disabled icmp6 since it is used for Neighbour Discovery protocol
 So if I want to have access to a disk concurrently by two hosts, I use either NFS or clustered filesystem togother with a way to export it, right?
ehhh * ufw default deny outgoing
how can i enable icmp6 with ufw ?
Yes, you need some file-system that can cope with concurrency
I don't know; I never use it, I work directly with the low-level tools
 Thanks, makes sense.
does anyone kno why wget and aptget dont use multiple simulatanious connections to speed up downloads?
or if its possible
it depends if the remote server supports chunked ranges or not
nathan_, it's almost simultaneous, but they have to be listed in sequence so it only appears sequential
is there an irc channel for ufw ?
!info aria2 | nathan_ if you want multiple connections there is
nathan_ if you want multiple connections there is: aria2 (source: aria2): High speed download utility. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.19.0-1 (wily), package size 1222 kB, installed size 4798 kB
thankyou
i just thought it might be handy for wget and apt-get!
i use fdm on windows and its possible to use multiple http mirrors for the one download, wouldnt it be cool if we could select say the 5 closest mirrors and use 1 connection to each for apt-get
well, for apt, if you were to use apt-cacher-ng as a local caching proxy, *and* configure apt-cacher-ng to use the jigdo-lite backend, it'd fetch (from compatible hosts) rather like a torrent
apt-cache-ng can also be configured to 'know' that multiple remotes are mirrors of each other, although I think that only aids in not duplicating local cached packages rather than enabling multiple simultaneous remote connections
interesting
i remeber reading about debtorrent which used torrents for apt-get
i just dont know who uploaded the torrent
for wget and multiple files (not a single file) from the same site, you can simply start multiple instances of wget with the "-nc" (no clobber) option so if one of those processes has already started fetching a file the other processes will skip over it and pick another file
thanks
Hi guys, who was helping me with my hard drive?
The thing is, it was disconnected, just needed to plug it back and worked.
is tab completion possible via adb push/pull?
r00trunner, https://askubuntu.com/questions/617262/terminal-auto-complete-doesnot-work-in-adb-command
Hey lads, just slapped 15.10 on my laptop, oddly enough cpufrequtils is behaving rather weirdly. If I try to set the cpu governor to "-g performance" it does so without problems, same with "-g powersaver", but when I try "-g ondemand" I get the "Error setting new values. Common errors:"-message. Any ideas?
Thx, but that's not what I ment. Probably my question was not specific enough. I ment to tab complete the directory structure of the phone from within my Linux system. E.g. adb pull /mnt/sdcard/<TAB> should show me available files/folders to choose from.
does it?
My question was if it would be possible.
no, not possible, unless adb itself implemented it
ive got problems accessing the web in a vm
with ubunti
evilchaos, why are you trying to do it through a VM?
hello! I have a weird problem with my new install (ubuntu 14.04 LTS), whenever I launch any given program the mouse isn't directly recognized. I can't use it on the new launched program. I've found a workaround by clicking on the toolbar so that I have access to it, but then I can* only click on the new program
it's like my mouse is captured virtualbox-style with every single program I use
because im testing something out
can you guys help me or point me towards a solution? Thanks!
can't make my video card output signal to display port. is there any reconfigure command i can give to force it to scan that port?
when you say 'web' do you mean just HTTP(s) servers, or do you mean basic connectivity? if the latter, is it when accesing by hostnames (DNs problem), or also when accessing using IP addresses (routing problem) ?
basic conectivity
hi my friends
is it both ways? Can the host reach the guest? Can the guest reach the host? (use tcpdump on both sides to check). Check the hypervisor's network configuration in the host, and how the guest is connected to the host (bridge, routed, NAT, etc.)
i cant get google to work
☺
 hehellk
hihi
some would argue that's a positive :)
you need to check your network setup with ping and tcpdump. commandline stuff
is there a way to figure out the passphrase of an ssh key?
the ssh key being my main ubuntu ssh key
daedeloth, nope, if you lost the passphrase you need to generate a new key
no. that is the idea behind the key and passphrase
wjlafrance, but I never entered a passphrase
I'm guessing gnome-keyring generated the passprhase for me?
it's automatically being added to ssh-agent when I boot
so it must be somewhere :)
in which case it'll likely be the password the user account had when the key was originally added
hm tried that already
it still works fine in ubuntu
are you able to use the key manually on the command-line, or is this just via gnome-keyring ?
I copied the key to windows to connect to a vpn, and there I had to enter the keyphrase
Hey lads, just slapped 15.10 on my laptop, oddly enough cpufrequtils is behaving rather weirdly. If I try to set the cpu governor to "-g performance" it does so without problems, same with "-g powersaver", but when I try "-g ondemand" I get the "Error setting new values. Common errors:"-message. Any ideas?
TJ-, I don't really know, I just do ssh server and it works :) I don't really know what magic is going on in the back
sirriffsalot  install indicator-cpufreq, an interactive applet
I'm not sure how the GUI tool does it, but it may be generating a wrapper passphrase that is unlocked by your user account password
yea that's what I was thinking as well
it's not in a gui tool, it's in any console
ok maybe it's in gnome console, can't try in a different terminal
using the ssh key from "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ..." requires you to enter the passphrase? that suggests you did set one, somehow
TJ-, yea, that works fine, no passphrase to enter
I'm guessing it works together with gnome keyring
no passphrase set... unrecommended. if anyone were to get that file from you, they'd have unrestricted access to any systems you do
but... sounds like it's stored somewhere
maybe you can look thru the keyring to see if its in there?
Gallomimia, well, that's what I'm trying to do and apparently that doesn't work :D
right, so in the gnome-keyring you need to *add* your user password authentication so it can unlock the keyring!
but it's not gnome-keyring, it's the ubuntu equivalent I need :)
I thought that might be it... there's an option to add the password, and I recall seeing a Wiki/AskUbuntu explanation of it a few months ago
well... whatever the darn thing is called, the keyring app
!find keyring
gir1.2-gnomekeyring-1.0, gnome-keyring, libgnome-keyring-common, libgnome-keyring-dev, libgnome-keyring0, libgnome-keyring0-dbg, libp11-kit-gnome-keyring, libpam-gnome-keyring, python-gnomekeyring, python-keyring (and 19 others) http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=keyring&searchon=names&suite=wily&section=all
it *needs* to have your user account password associated with it to allow it to unlock the keyring
yea, but it probably generates a passphrase instead of using your user password
TJ- what?
de-facto, wrong mention I'm guessing :)
sorry, tab miscomplete :)
2nd answer here is what I'm trying to describe: http://askubuntu.com/questions/65281/how-to-recover-reset-forgotten-gnome-keyring-password
TJ- np
oh I found out that seahorse has a GUI :D
seahorse is the GUI :)
Grrrr sorry!
: seahorse is the GUI :)
alright :D cool, ok I'm resetting the passphrase and trying again
i can't get an nvidia .run driver to install on 14.04LTS. i need 361.42 for some stuff. it complains that nouveau is still installed but no nouveau packages are. i've blacklisted it i think. i also tried xorg-edgers ppa but it doesn't have the driver i want for trusty
the best place now is the graphics-drivers PPA
see https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa?field.series_filter=trusty
what is its url for apt-add-repository?
its not windows u must install driver via apt-get
with a ppa
see the PPA page
ah yeah i found it
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-364
cool that looks like it's working
thanks
i just installed nvidia-361 from that repo. now i can't get my main monitor on display port to turn on or be detected. only the DVI-D monitor is working. gtx 780Ti
nvidia-settings    in terminal
yeah that doesn't help
Wow i love Ubuntu Mate !
i've fussed with that for hours
the monitor just says "no signal detected" and goes to sleep
this is how they make new versions of ubuntu
they let ubuntu mate
jroot, why
did u restart when u installed the nvidia driver ?
yep. i've done it several times
Anyone got a good Ubuntu hosting company they would recommend ?
also this is not the first time i've had grief over getting the monitor to work
ok i don't know what is happening then maybe try the nvidia-364 driver
plenty. for what purpose?
Web Dev Mostly
digital ocean
Hmm
connection issues with that...
0o
for you? or to everyone else?
I just recently had similar issue, but laptop external monitor. I rebooted with screen unplugged and plugged in only after logging in. Helped. Had this issue few times in the past
oh yeah... interesting
is there a difference between server and desktop kernel-wise?
i've had this problem several times, and still no idea how it was fixed
Kubuntu xenial, mind you
no.
no
ty<3
check both kern.log and Xorg.0.log for clues
hmm
have you used "xrandr -q" to see what the system's view of connected outputs is?
Will try her on Mate...
I think putty has some issues
DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
also, is the system using hybrid graphics or multiple GPUs ?
that's the opposite of what i want to see.
it's a singular GPU
no embedded gpu on cpu
check Xorg.0.log in case there's some output-related problem going on
other than that I'd suggest a physical connector/cabling issue
hotkey for changing languages ?
generally when i do fix it it's from wiggling plugs or something
i'm going to try what madwizard suggested
reboot, with unplugged, then plug in
you're almost confirming the physical issue then
inspect the connectors, make sure they're not bent, there's no foreign material in them, etc.
does one seem particularly loose, maybe, and not making a good connection?
they do wiggle quite a lot. it alarming really
hi - i have a package installed that i would like to know where it came from .. all teh commands i run indicate it catme from /var/lib/dpkg/status .. help?!
course it doesn't help that the damn monitor turns itself off really quickly
if it doesn't detect a signal that is
so you installed it manually
or the repo you used is was deleted in the meantime.
figured .. how do i know where the package was residing? i mean was in /tmp? /var/tmp?
i dont think there is that information. you could look at "apt-cache show packagename"
"apt-cache policy <package-name>"
same
same
here's my real confusing thing tho TJ- i didn't touch the connectors at all. the thing that changed which caused the display to stop working was drivers and reboot. it was working just fine before
what does "same" mean? please be more precise and descriptive
thats all you get
HA!!! i just found /var/cache/apt/archives !!!!! :D
In the past I've found similar issues and tapping the keyboard is enough to provoke them sometimes
that is where the packages are cached to. but its not where you put them in the first place
can i reinstall from that archive?
its not an archive. its just a local cache. but yes you can
purrr-fect :D
if apt has the package then "apt-get --reinstall install <package-name>" will do that
actually i need to install it on a different machien . but thanks
MonkeyDust, I really prefer cpufrequtils, there should be a solution :)
make sure you take any dependencies along then
apt-offline might be of interest to you, depending on your requirement
I'm trying to install NVIDIA drivers for my GeForce 940M. I've tried the proprietary drivers, downloading and installing the drivers from nvidia.com, using ppa:xorg-edgers, ppa:graphics-drivers, and neither of those worked. I keep getting either black screen, login loop, or low graphics mode. Does anybody know what I should try?
I have an integrated Intel card, by the way, and I want to use my NVIDIA.
sounds like a hybrid issue with Prime. Has it ever worked?
TJ-, I installed Ubuntu 15.10 yesterday and I got it to work eventually. I then found out I had to switch to 14.04, and I couldn't get it to work.

I am trying to get cgroups to work. Can someone tell we in which package I can find the 'service' for cgred?
i am getting "unknown" when i check my runlevel, any ideas? (i am trying to run a python script as a service, which doesn't succeed, and led me to check my runlevel), using ubuntu 14.04
Where would I find instructions on getting java working with chrome under Ubuntu?
that doesn't surprise me since there'll have been a lot of improvements between 14.04 and 15.10
!java | wad start here
wad start here: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
so do you think there might be no way I can make it work with 14.04?
A *lot* of hybrid/prime bugs have been worked out over the last 2 years
I can't find any service related to cgroups. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
I see. I'll see what I can do then. Thanks a lot!
I am using 15.10
MonkeyDust, thanks!!
hello. I use ubuntu 15.10 and any wine app doesn't have sound. What can I do?
Anyone know how to get wifi working with Intel Centrino Ultimate N 6300?
15.10 comes with IWLWifi firmware vesrion 6, but it refuses to connect to the AP
I tried the modprobe workarounds, and they had no efffect
RFKill lists nothing blocked
This is becoming more and more strange. After performing acs cgroups|awk '{print $1}'|xargs apt-file list |grep service the only services I get cgmanager/cgproxy non of which I am looking for ( and find esential ).
Google hasn't given me any help....

hi there
i got a process which goes down on friday
where i can find what happen to that one ?
i am getting gsql running on another terminal
how can i know how many terminal opened..
bujji, ps -A in terminal
bujji, alternatively to make it easier, ps -A |grep terminal
ps -A |grep terminal nothing it showing
bujji, do you see anything looking like terminal in the output of 'w'?
yes it showing uptime and the user logged info it showing only one user.
bujji, if you are looking for your x terminal sessions type 'xprop' and when the cursor changes click on the terminal and check 'class'
xprop|grep CLASS bujji
usr13, http://pastebin.com/aU3iRJRM
what it gives
bujji, then name of your terminal emulator
bujji, when you will get it ( the first thing in "" ) you can grep for it in ps
bujji, ps -ef |grep "thingfromclss"
bujji, in my output you can see that there is one virtual terminal started : me        1733  1584  0 mar30 ?        00:00:08 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/terminator
usr13, ...you still here?
unable to open display
do i need to install?
bujji, do you know are you running X11, grahical interface?
bujji, maybe I misunderstood you. If you are looking for terminal sessions and not terminal emulators just use 'w|grep pts'.
it showing pts/3
bujji, so you have only one session running.
user pts/3 means?
bujji, user - name of the user who is connected and pts stands for pseudoterminal session.
3 ?
bujji, not sure how the numering works, but the more sessions are open the number increases. I have 2 opend so it looks like:
bujji, me       pts/3    :0.0             śro22   37:00   0.71s  0.08s /bin/bash
me       pts/6    :0.0             śro22   39:41   0.08s  0.08s /bin/bash
how can we close the opened sessions?
bujji, simpli logout.
bujji, type exit or ctrl+D
bujji, got2go
ok man thank you
how do I install my drivers for my laptop on ubutnu 14.04.04? is it done auto?
yes, it's auto
if everything works fine just leave it ;)
you can install some prop. drivers if app "additional drivers"
for example for video and etc (if you need so)

hello, is MacChanger persistent after reboot?
usr13, have you ever used the bt_coex_active fix?
ubuntu boot from usb error: panic occured. switching back to text console...dahell?
<ChunkzZ> I use default video drivers (open source) and they are great. I will even play some games (most of they are basic or older then 2010). But if you want play some modern games 90% you will need to install prop. drivers.
thanks.
<ChunkzZ> maybe this will help http://askubuntu.com/questions/471012/ubuntu-14-04-lts-fails-to-start-with-a-kernel-panic

i don't think MacChanger persists after reboot
So back to my problem :). I have ubuntu 15.10 x64, and wine x32. I haven't sound in C&C, hearthone and etc. I try use ALSA_DEFAULT_PCM="plug:dmix" and some configs but zero result. Any help?
I added a script to /etc/rc3.d and gave it exec permission but it didn't execute on startup, why it might happend?

Does anyone have experience with the intel centrino ultimate-n 6300 on 15.10?
usr13, was helping, but seems to have disappeared.
can i fix it?
when running update-ca-certificates the the terminal gives: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15618441/ ? what does this mean?
Does esorotica still comes here?
i am trying to install something using pip and i get an error "The directory '/home/user/.cache/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled" what can cause this? i checked the prmissions they seem fine
nope. Last time they were in my logs was back in 2015. also, I don't see them ever speaking.. just you asking if they were here back in 2014.
sorry, I was mistaken about that last part.

hello
i'm having some troubles wiht my ubuntu
i just made a fresh install of 15.10 and i'm using a tp-link wm722n wifi usb adapter and at some random interval i'm losing internet connection
if I have question for shell scripting can I do it here or where would I go?
in bash? I'd ask #bash
ok.
there's a pretty good troubleshoot of that wifi card here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/512727/how-to-install-driver-for-tp-link-tl-wn722n-on-ubuntu-14-04
lorddoskias1 ^^^
thank you, i will take a look now
however, this card (sort of) works out of the box, that link there is if your card is not recognised by ubuntu, rather all the necessary modules are working for me
is there a minimal image of 14.04.04?

hello, I'm trying to update my sysrq config in proc... but it says it says permission denied. here's the command I used: "sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq"
I want to be able to use all sysrq commands.. but I think this is reset everytime I boot even if I manage to edit it. it's not REALLY a file so I believe the echo command is correct...
not sudoedit which manages to work until i reboot
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
brb
you want /etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf
thanks, I'll try that.
hloo
it works.
thank you

so... client wants to dual boot win10 and ubuntu on the same drive.  both with encryption.
is there even a reasonable way to do this?
hello
#ubuntu+1
help
i'm going to pitch the idea to us bitlocker for win10 and just run linux in wmware workstation
linux has encrypted partitions too
can anyone help me with configuring the alps touchpad. it just randomly quit working. but the buttons still work. i'm on a dell inspiron 1525.
i once had a bootable usb with "liberte linux" that was completely encrypted. but idk how they do it
does it have an Fn key on/off switch
I believe during install it actually asks you if you want to encrypt the home partition or if you want to encrypt the entire partition
says "LUKS"
yeah, what would the problem be?
trevor_s, if your machine has tpm i think it will hard..
can anyone help me with fixing my touch pad?
Mathisen, you can disable tpm
it's enabled. i can tap when in a url and when i the buttons work. it just randomly stopped working
i'm just not finding any good documentation dual booting win10 and linux both with encryption
without using truecrypt
which isn't an option
you want to use the same encryption scheme for both? or don't mind separate schemes?
TJ-, i dont mind different schemes so long as they play nice with one another and there's an option to boot to both of them
to each of them?
well the only one that is cross-platform is going to be Truecrypt
it would be way too easy to just use bitlocker and run linux in a VM
native for Linux is LUKS+dm_crypt
if someone would help me i would really appreciate it. i'm trying to learn how to use linux and i want to learn how to program
however, there's no reason not to use the native encryption schemes for each. They will only encrypt the partition(s) the OS itself uses, so Windows can use bitlocker and Linux can use LUKS+dm_crypt
Hi all. I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04 server to run Kodi. All seems good except for the gamepad. Would anyone have advice how to enable it? It was working fine under OpenElec without any additional packages/libraries. Am I missing some?

Hello
hello, what do you do to resolve a blocked package install, such as `openjdk-7-jre : Depends: openjdk-7-jre-headless (= 7u51-2.4.6-1ubuntu4) but it is not going to be installed` - I run into these from time to time, and I don't ever understand a) how it happens, nor b) how to resolve/prevent. My first inclination was to minimize PPA and thirdparty deb archives, which I have done, but this still seems to snag me

hi
how can I know if my video card is working?
xrandr -q
can give some hints
me?
wait no, it doesn't tell much about video card
glxinfo
or something like that
can't remember
SchrodingersScat, is there anything else I can check?
andybrine,  Dash ->  Startup
^ is a possibility
anyone?
what brand card?
squinty I dont have skype in my autostart applications
its strange :/
yup. perhaps crontab?
Gallomimia, I want to know if render is working etc, glxinfo was the command, something like that
thats why im a little stumped
do you remember
can't find it
no, i can't either
for me, i look in nvidia settings
shows me loads of info. but that was installed with the proprietary drivers
alejandra_,  maybe  glxinfo -B
glxinfo comes from mesa-utils package
squinty, SchrodingersScat anymore Ideas on why skype is starting on startup?
I think it maybe just work removing skype all together
lol
Im not a fan of skype anymore :/
good call, and idk, is it an init.d? or a cronjob?  mine does not start on boot when unchecked in skype thing.  It's freedom-hating software anyway.

!sysv-rc-conf | andybrine
SchrodingersScat where canI check init.d?
Sadly I chat with people on SKype every day
  anyhow, check in the repositories for sysv-rc-conf, to stop services running at startup, need to run it as sudo btw
!find sysv-rc-conf

I can't run synaptic as root on Ubuntu 15.10!  When I try, I get this error message, despite having been able to run synaptic as root for months.  http://pastebin.com/f2tDyKrD  Any tips?

   is probably there, just under some other name I'd think

If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)

Hi, I’m wondering if when I add ssh keys to a user’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys does that disable the ability for that user’s ability to sign in w/ a password? Or do I need to take additional steps to disable the ability to log in over ssh w/ a password once I’ve added authorized_keys? As always, thanks for the help!
IRT BlueProtoman . With 2 /home directories mounted, how does the system know the controlling authority ?
I don't know, but why would that matter in my scenario?  Up until yesterday I haven't had this issue at all.
i just answered my own question by sshing into another one of my boxes and then sshing into the 1st box and logging in via password. Also, I think I found how to disable password login over SSH here: 107.170.194.223
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring#Disable_Password_Authentication
I am always amazed at what I do not know and I have no experience with mir. But, I do think the .ICEauthority file is required, and we can make one up .
OK, let's do it.
Worth a shot : From the F1 console logged in as the user profile with the problem run ' touch .ICEauthority ; chown <username>:<username> .ICEauthority ; chmod 600 .ICEauthority ' Where you are you in "your" /home directory so admin privileges are not required and if used may really mess things up .
 /whois cuB3D
OK, now what?
Hey all, is there a good way to make ubuntu ask to confirm a shutdown if you have programs running (especially in a different workspace)?
' ls -al /home ' is the proper username listed ? also check ' ls -al /home/<username> ' . If all is good .. reboot for a whole new reset .
Yes, I'm still jesse
:) reboot the box, let's see what happens .
 /lastlog Jordan_U
I see only one /home/, within which there is another mount to jessie/Common.
Yeah, that should be the case, right?  I'm the only user on this machine, and /jesse/Common is a common partition I use to share data between my Windows and Linux partitions (music, homework, code, etc.)
I need a little bit of help understanding memory usage and swap space.  My server seems to keep putting things in swap space and leaving them there, even though there is plenty of memory free. when it does this it noticble effects performance.  All pages load substantially slower, until i forceably remove things from swap (sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a) http://i.imgur.com/eKcJ1sr.png
right now, its using about 6 GB of 16GB of ram, but still putting things in swapspace!
have you tried changing your swappiness value?
nope
its at 60 now
what would be a better value?
Not sure if there's an optimal amount, but reducing it will definitely make your box swap less
you can try tinkering with sysctl to do it temporarily then put it /etc/sysctl.conf once you find a good amount
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#What_is_swappiness_and_how_do_I_change_it.3F
good call
thanks for the advice
no problem, hope it helps!
I've got an odd issue. All of my jump drives are reporting as read-only, but I do not have them set to read only. Any ideas?
Also, the file browser is not letting me change the permissions for the jump drive.
What would be the best method to combine the free space of 4 servers into once filesystem over a network? all three have different drive sizes but in total it would be 15TB and would like to be able to add new servers in at any time, no redundancy needed since its bulk data that can be easly replaced
JRWR, suggest you ask #ubuntu-serer

Is it possible for me to install the ubuntu 15.10 version of libpthread-workqueue on ubuntu 14.04?
So...I've got networking again.   But now if I try to change from our 2.4ghz channel to our 5ghz network manager crashes, and loses the networks.
=/
So I've got a quick question, I'm booted to on a flash drive and I have another flash drive plugged in
I'm wanting to install xubuntu on the other flash drive, how do I do this?
Rarien,  same as if it was any other hard drive
start the installer and choose the other usb as destination to install in
Okay , I think I tried that, lemme give it another try.
how do I set up VPN connection for my ubuntu server
Rarien,  BUT  I highly advise unpluging any other HDDs  to avoid issues
So I choose the "something else" option and choose the other SD and it tell me
Rarien,  as in total loss of data on your drives
"No root file system is defined"
I don't mind that Rave1, thank you though.
Rarien,  just making it clear is all
I have an HDD that is corrupted so I intend on running xubuntu on this computer solely off of the USB. (Which is a micro SD)
"something else" means "manual partioning". so you need to do the setup your own
Oh, hmm
Well if I choose "Erase disk and install xubuntu", it'll default to the HDD, right?
it will name the destination there. i dont have the installer in front of me
Oh, that was simple enough.
I didn't want to hit "next" just incase it was just going to start it.
Thank you. :D
Rarien,  make note of what your USB (sdcard) is named
Yeah it's pretty easy to remember, smartcardreader or something.
or sdc
Yeah, I'm going to have to remember that, thank you, Lol
how do I set up VPN connection for my ubuntu server
This IRC is so helpful compared to the others that I've been on.
hi
Is there a preferred file system that I should format the USB as?
ext4
I read somewhere that it was ext4 for HDDs and ext2 or 3 for flash drives, etc.
But that was for puppy linux.
every so often, my cpu hits about 3500% load, and the hardrive goes nuts, basically the entire laptop locks up and i have to hard shutdown. what loag do you guys need to see?
So you sure?
*logs
hello everyone, can you please help me with this postgresql problem; http://paste.ubuntu.com/15622389/ ?
Rarien,  and there was a time that it was advised not to use a swap on flash drive installs. not sure of the current feeling on that
uname --all is Linux Ben-laptop 4.2.0-16-generic #19-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 8 15:35:06 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
That's how I had it setup on puppy linux (which doesn't support much new hardware hence me moving to ubuntu)
and it was running fine.
running ubuntu mate 15.10
I'ma just try ext4 and see how it goes
Rarien,  i always use ext4 on Sd card installs now days
Oh okay, cool then.  Thank you for all the help. o:
Hmm, I used gparted to format the flash drive as ext4 and nothing else, I go to "Install Now" and it's telling me "Some of the partitions you created are too small."?
It's an 8gb card.
As far as I know I only have one partition on the whole flash drive.
Rarien,  8gb is marginal to install xubuntu
So what does that mean?
means you may need to use a diffenrt distro
Lame
I have a new totaly fresh just installed debian mate  4.97 gb  and it would have much less software than default xubuntu
What about lubuntu?
not sure you would need to check installed size
You should be able to install Xubuntu on a 8GB partition
How?
I also wouldn't mind lubuntu, they both have great hardware support.
IDK, but the documentation states you need 6.1GB of free space
Hmm
what setup did you make?
What do you mean?
I haven't installed anything yet.
you said you made partitions
Oh, I did ext4?
and how much partitions? how big?
1 partition, 7.4gb
(keep in mind we dont know or see what you do there)
please put the full error you get there onto paste.ubuntu.com and show it here
@K1l_ http://i.imgur.com/vGkShXP.png
ubuntu.  enjoy.
how many partitions wants the installer to create?
How would I figure that out?
it says so under tha warning
are you doing manual partitioning or one of the automated options
The automated option
and please run in a terminal "sudo parted -l | nc termbin.com 9999" so we can have a look at partitions and disks
@k1l_ http://i.imgur.com/LE85a6O.png
Okay, one second
http://termbin.com/x4ui
how much RAM is in this box?
6gb
hmm, could be that its trying to make 2 or 3 partiions. which then will be too small.
[23:45]  * tgm4883 wonders if partman is doing something weird with swap
so i guess you should go for advanced partitioning tool and just use the one ext4 partition as "/" in the installer
yes, i think its trying to create more partitions like a swap with the size of ram. (because the installer is made for installing onto hdd/sdd which are way larger)
yep
Is there an ubuntu version for smaller drives?
how can i reload udev rules?
just use manual partioning like i described
6GB RAM and a 8GB hard drive is not exactly common
goddard, sudo udevadm control --reload
another problem I'm having with GNOME Classic that never used to happen with GNOME Flashback: enter password, and unlock screen just sits there like it is waiting on something else
