Abstract. A real-time algorithm to detect eye blinks
in a video sequence from a standard camera is pro-
posed. Recent landmark detectors, trained on in-the-
wild datasets exhibit excellent robustness against a
head orientation with respect to a camera, varying
illumination and facial expressions. We show that
the landmarks are detected precisely enough to reli-
ably estimate the level of the eye opening. The pro-
posed algorithm therefore estimates the landmark
positions, extracts a single scalar quantity – eye as-
pect ratio (EAR) – characterizing the eye opening in
each frame. Finally, an SVM classiﬁer detects eye
blinks as a pattern of EAR values in a short tempo-
ral window. The simple algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art results on two standard datasets.

1. Introduction

Detecting eye blinks is important for instance in
systems that monitor a human operator vigilance,
e.g. driver drowsiness [5, 13], in systems that warn
a computer user staring at the screen without blink-
ing for a long time to prevent the dry eye and the
computer vision syndromes [17, 7, 8], in human-
computer interfaces that ease communication for dis-
abled people [15], or for anti-spooﬁng protection in
face recognition systems [11].
Existing methods are either active or passive. Ac-
tive methods are reliable but use special hardware,
often expensive and intrusive, e.g. infrared cameras
and illuminators [2], wearable devices, glasses with
a special close-up cameras observing the eyes [10].
While the passive systems rely on a standard remote
camera only.
Many methods have been proposed to automati-
cally detect eye blinks in a video sequence. Several
methods are based on a motion estimation in the eye
region. Typically, the face and eyes are detected by

a Viola-Jones type detector. Next, motion in the eye
area is estimated from optical ﬂow, by sparse track-
ing [7, 8], or by frame-to-frame intensity differenc-
ing and adaptive thresholding. Finally, a decision is
made whether the eyes are or are not covered by eye-
lids [9, 15]. A different approach is to infer the state
of the eye opening from a single image, as e.g. by
correlation matching with open and closed eye tem-
plates [4], a heuristic horizontal or vertical image in-
tensity projection over the eye region [5, 6], a para-
metric model ﬁtting to ﬁnd the eyelids [18], or active
shape models [14].
A major drawback of the previous approaches is
that they usually implicitly impose too strong re-
quirements on the setup, in the sense of a relative
face-camera pose (head orientation), image resolu-
tion, illumination, motion dynamics, etc. Especially
the heuristic methods that use raw image intensity
are likely to be very sensitive despite their real-time
performance.

However nowadays, robust real-time facial land-
mark detectors that capture most of the character-
istic points on a human face image, including eye
corners and eyelids, are available, see Fig. 1. Most
of the state-of-the-art landmark detectors formulate
a regression problem, where a mapping from an im-
age into landmark positions [16] or into other land-
mark parametrization [1] is learned. These mod-
ern landmark detectors are trained on “in-the-wild
datasets” and they are thus robust to varying illu-
mination, various facial expressions, and moderate
non-frontal head rotations. An average error of the
landmark localization of a state-of-the-art detector
is usually below ﬁve percent of the inter-ocular dis-
tance. Recent methods run even signiﬁcantly super
real-time [12].
Therefore, we propose a simple but efﬁcient al-
gorithm to detect eye blinks by using a recent facial
landmark detector. A single scalar quantity that re-
ﬂects a level of the eye opening is derived from the
landmarks. Finally, having a per-frame sequence of
the eye opening estimates, the eye blinks are found
by an SVM classiﬁer that is trained on examples of
blinking and non-blinking patterns.
Facial segmentation model presented in [14] is
similar to the proposed method. However, their sys-
tem is based on active shape models with reported
processing time of about 5 seconds per frame for the
segmentation, and the eye opening signal is normal-
ized by statistics estimated by observing a longer se-
quence. The system is thus usable for ofﬂine pro-
cessing only. The proposed algorithm runs real-time,
since the extra costs of the eye opening from land-
marks and the linear SVM are negligible.
The contributions of the paper are:

1. Ability of two state-of-the-art
landmark de-
tectors [1, 16] to reliably distinguish between
the open and closed eye states is quantita-
tively demonstrated on a challenging in-the-
wild dataset and for various face image resolu-
tions.

2. A novel real-time eye blink detection algorithm
which integrates a landmark detector and a clas-
siﬁer is proposed. The evaluation is done on two
standard datasets [11, 8] achieving state-of-the-
art results.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: The
algorithm is detailed in Sec. 2, experimental valida-

tion and evaluation is presented in Sec. 3. Finally,
Sec. 4 concludes the paper.

2. Proposed method

The eye blink is a fast closing and reopening of
a human eye. Each individual has a little bit different
pattern of blinks. The pattern differs in the speed of
closing and opening, a degree of squeezing the eye
and in a blink duration. The eye blink lasts approxi-

mately 100-400 ms.
We propose to exploit state-of-the-art facial land-
mark detectors to localize the eyes and eyelid con-
tours. From the landmarks detected in the image,
we derive the eye aspect ratio (EAR) that is used as
an estimate of the eye opening state. Since the per-
frame EAR may not necessarily recognize the eye
blinks correctly, a classiﬁer that takes a larger tem-
poral window of a frame into account is trained.

2.1. Description of features

For every video frame, the eye landmarks are de-
tected. The eye aspect ratio (EAR) between height
and width of the eye is computed.

EAR =

(cid:107)p2 − p6(cid:107) + (cid:107)p3 − p5(cid:107)
2(cid:107)p1 − p4(cid:107)

,

(1)

where p1 , . . . , p6 are the 2D landmark locations, de-
picted in Fig. 1.
The EAR is mostly constant when an eye is open
and is getting close to zero while closing an eye. It
is partially person and head pose insensitive. Aspect
ratio of the open eye has a small variance among indi-
viduals and it is fully invariant to a uniform scaling of
the image and in-plane rotation of the face. Since eye
blinking is performed by both eyes synchronously,
the EAR of both eyes is averaged. An example of
an EAR signal over the video sequence is shown in
Fig. 1, 2, 7.
A similar feature to measure the eye opening was
suggested in [9], but it was derived from the eye seg-
mentation in a binary image.

2.2. Classiﬁcation

It generally does not hold that low value of the
EAR means that a person is blinking. A low value
of the EAR may occur when a subject closes his/her
eyes intentionally for a longer time or performs a fa-
cial expression, yawning, etc., or the EAR captures a
short random ﬂuctuation of the landmarks.
Therefore, we propose a classiﬁer that takes a
larger temporal window of a frame as an input. For
the 30fps videos, we experimentally found that ±6
frames can have a signiﬁcant impact on a blink detec-
tion for a frame where an eye is the most closed when
blinking. Thus, for each frame, a 13-dimensional
feature is gathered by concatenating the EARs of its
±6 neighboring frames.
This is implemented by a linear SVM classiﬁer
(called EAR SVM) trained from manually anno-
tated sequences. Positive examples are collected as

ground-truth blinks, while the negatives are those
that are sampled from parts of the videos where no
blink occurs, with 5 frames spacing and 7 frames
margin from the ground-truth blinks. While testing, a
classiﬁer is executed in a scanning-window fashion.
A 13-dimensional feature is computed and classiﬁed
by EAR SVM for each frame except the beginning
and ending of a video sequence.

3. Experiments

Two types of experiments were carried out: The
experiments that measure accuracy of the landmark
detectors, see Sec. 3.1, and the experiments that eval-
uate performance of the whole eye blink detection
algorithm, see Sec 3.2.

3.1. Accuracy of landmark detectors

To evaluate accuracy of tested landmark detectors,
we used the 300-VW dataset [19]. It is a dataset con-
taining 50 videos where each frame has associated a
precise annotation of facial landmarks. The videos
are “in-the-wild”, mostly recorded from a TV.
The purpose of the following tests is to demon-
strate that recent landmark detectors are particularly
robust and precise in detecting eyes, i.e. the eye-
corners and contour of the eyelids. Therefore we pre-
pared a dataset, a subset of the 300-VW, containing
sample images with both open and closed eyes. More
precisely, having the ground-truth landmark annota-
tion, we sorted the frames for each subject by the eye
aspect ratio (EAR in Eq. (1)) and took 10 frames of
the highest ratio (eyes wide open), 10 frames of the
lowest ratio (mostly eyes tightly shut) and 10 frames
sampled randomly. Thus we collected 1500 images.
Moreover, all the images were later subsampled (suc-
cessively 10 times by factor 0.75) in order to evaluate
accuracy of tested detectors on small face images.
Two state-of-the-art
landmark detectors were
tested: Chehra [1] and Intraface [16]. Both run in
real-time1 . Samples from the dataset are shown in
Fig. 3. Notice that faces are not always frontal to the
camera, the expression is not always neutral, peo-
ple are often emotionally speaking or smiling, etc.
Sometimes people wear glasses, hair may occasion-
ally partially occlude one of the eyes. Both detectors
perform generally well, but the Intraface is more ro-
bust to very small face images, sometimes at impres-
sive extent as shown in Fig. 3.

1 Intraface runs in 50 Hz on a standard laptop.

traface [16]. Original images (left) with inter-ocular
distance (IOD) equal to 63 (top) and 53 (bottom) pix-
els. Images subsampled (right) to IOD equal to 6.3
(top) and 17 (bottom).

Quantitatively, the accuracy of the landmark de-
tection for a face image is measured by the average
relative landmark localization error, deﬁned as usu-
ally

where xi is the ground-truth location of landmark i
in the image, ˆxi is an estimated landmark location by
a detector, N is a number of landmarks and normal-
ization factor κ is the inter-ocular distance (IOD), i.e.
Euclidean distance between eye centers in the image.
First, a standard cumulative histogram of the aver-
age relative landmark localization error  was calcu-
lated, see Fig. 4, for a complete set of 49 landmarks
and also for a subset of 12 landmarks of the eyes only,
since these landmarks are used in the proposed eye
blink detector. The results are calculated for all the
original images that have average IOD around 80 px,
and also for all “small” face images (including sub-
sampled ones) having IOD ≤ 50 px. For all land-
marks, Chehra has more occurrences of very small
errors (up to 5 percent of the IOD), but Intraface is
more robust having more occurrences of errors be-
low 10 percent of the IOD. For eye landmarks only,

tion error of all 49 landmarks (top) and 12 landmarks
of the eyes (bottom). The histograms are computed
for original resolution images (solid lines) and a sub-
set of small images (IOD ≤ 50 px).

(cid:80)

the Intraface is always more precise than Chehra. As
already mentioned, the Intraface is much more robust
to small images than Chehra. This behaviour is fur-
ther observed in the following experiment.
Taking a set of all 15k images, we measured a
mean localization error µ as a function of a face im-
age resolution determined by the IOD. More pre-
cisely, µ = 1|S |
j∈S j , i.e. average error over set of
face images S having the IOD in a given range. Re-
sults are shown in Fig. 5. Plots have errorbars of stan-
dard deviation. It is seen that Chehra fails quickly
for images with IOD < 20 px. For larger faces, the
mean error is comparable, although slightly better for
Intraface for the eye landmarks.
The last test is directly related to the eye blink de-
tector. We measured accuracy of EAR as a func-
tion of the IOD. Mean EAR error is deﬁned as a
mean absolute difference between the true and the
estimated EAR. The plots are computed for two sub-
sets: closed/closing (average true ratio 0.05 ± 0.05)

tion of the face image resolution computed for all
landmarks and eye landmarks only.

and open eyes (average true ratio 0.4 ± 0.1). The
error is higher for closed eyes. The reason is prob-
ably that both detectors are more likely to output
open eyes in case of a failure. It is seen that ratio
error for IOD < 20 px causes a major confusion
between open/close eye states for Chehra, neverthe-
less for larger faces the ratio is estimated precisely
enough to ensure a reliable eye blink detection.

3.2. Eye blink detector evaluation

We evaluate on two standard databases with
ground-truth annotations of blinks. The ﬁrst one is
ZJU [11] consisting of 80 short videos of 20 sub-
jects. Each subject has 4 videos: 2 with and 2 without
glasses, 3 videos are frontal and 1 is an upward view.
The 30fps videos are of size 320 × 240 px. An av-
erage video length is 136 frames and contains about
3.6 blinks in average. An average IOD is 57.4 pixels.
In this database, subjects do not perform any notice-
able facial expressions. They look straight into the
camera at close distance, almost do not move, do not

images with higher ratio (open
eyes).

either smile nor speak. A ground-truth blink is de-
ﬁned by its beginning frame, peak frame and ending
frame. The second database Eyeblink8 [8] is more
challenging. It consists of 8 long videos of 4 sub-
jects that are smiling, rotating head naturally, cover-
ing face with hands, yawning, drinking and looking
down probably on a keyboard. These videos have
length from 5k to 11k frames, also 30fps, with a res-
olution 640 × 480 pixels and an average IOD 62.9
pixels. They contain about 50 blinks on average per
video. Each frame belonging to a blink is annotated
by half-open or close state of the eyes. We consider
half blinks, which do not achieve the close state, as
full blinks to be consistent with the ZJU.
Besides testing the proposed EAR SVM methods,
that are trained to detect the speciﬁc blink pattern,
we compare with a simple baseline method, which
only thresholds the EAR in Eq. (1) values. The EAR
SVM classiﬁers are tested with both landmark detec-
tors Chehra [1] and Intraface [16].

section with detected blinks. The number of false
negatives is counted as a number of the ground-truth
blinks which do not intersect detected blinks. The
number of false positives is equal to the number of
detected blinks minus the number of true positives
plus a penalty for detecting too long blinks. The
penalty is counted only for detecting blinks twice
longer then an average blink of length A. Every long
blink of length L is counted L
A times as a false posi-
tive. The number of all possibly detectable blinks is
computed as number of frames of a video sequence
divided by subject average blink length following
Drutarovsky and Fogelton [8].
The ZJU database appears relatively easy.
It
mostly holds that every eye closing is an eye blink.
Consequently, the precision-recall curves shown in
Fig. 8a of the EAR thresholding and both EAR SVM
classiﬁers are almost identical. These curves were
calculated by spanning a threshold of the EAR and
SVM output score respectively. All our methods
outperform other detectors [9, 8, 5]. The published
methods presented the precision and the recall for a
single operation point only, not the precision-recall
curve. See Fig. 8a for comparison.
The precision-recall curves in Fig. 8b shows eval-
uation on the Eyeblink8 database. We observe that in
this challenging database the EAR thresholding lags
behind both EAR SVM classiﬁers. The thresholding
fails when a subject smiles (has narrowed eyes - see
an example in Fig. 7), has a side view or when the
subject closes his/her eyes for a time longer than a
blink duration. Both SVM detectors performs much
better, the Intraface detector based SVM is even a
little better than the Chehra SVM. Both EAR SVM
detectors outperform the method by Drutarovsky and
Fogelton [8] by a signiﬁcant margin.
Finally, we measured a dependence of the whole
blink detector accuracy on the average IOD over the
dataset. Every frame of the ZJU database was sub-
sampled to 90%, 80%, ..., 10% of its original reso-
lution. Both Chehra-SVM and Intraface-SVM were
used for evaluation. For each resolution, the area un-
der the precision-recall curve (AUC) was computed.
The result is shown in Fig. 9. We can see that with
Chehra landmarks the accuracy remains very high
until average IOD is about 30 px. The detector fails
on images with the IOD < 20 px. Intraface land-
marks are much better in low resolutions. This con-
ﬁrms our previous study on the accuracy of land-
marks in Sec. 3.1.

The experiment with EAR SVM is done in a cross-
dataset fashion. It means that the SVM classiﬁer is
trained on the Eyeblink8 and tested on the ZJU and
vice versa.
To evaluate detector accuracy, predicted blinks are
compared with the ground-truth blinks. The number
of true positives is determined as a number of the
ground-truth blinks which have a non-empty inter-

4. Conclusion

A real-time eye blink detection algorithm was
presented. We quantitatively demonstrated that
regression-based facial landmark detectors are pre-
cise enough to reliably estimate a level of eye open-
ness. While they are robust to low image quality (low
image resolution in a large extent) and in-the-wild

phenomena as non-frontality, bad illumination, facial
expressions, etc.
State-of-the-art on two standard datasets was
achieved using the robust landmark detector fol-
lowed by a simple eye blink detection based on the
SVM. The algorithm runs in real-time, since the ad-
ditional computational costs for the eye blink detec-
tion are negligible besides the real-time landmark de-
tectors.
The proposed SVM method that uses a temporal
window of the eye aspect ratio (EAR), outperforms
the EAR thresholding. On the other hand, the thresh-
olding is usable as a single image classiﬁer to detect
the eye state, in case that a longer sequence is not
available.
We see a limitation that a ﬁxed blink duration for
all subjects was assumed, although everyone’s blink
lasts differently. The results could be improved by an
adaptive approach. Another limitation is in the eye
opening estimate. While EAR is estimated from a 2D
image, it is fairly insensitive to a head orientation, but
may lose discriminability for out of plane rotations.
A solution might be to deﬁne the EAR in 3D. There
are landmark detectors that estimate a 3D pose (po-
sition and orientation) of a 3D model of landmarks,
e.g. [1, 3].

Abstract. A real-time algorithm to detect eye blinks
in a video sequence from a standard camera is pro-
posed. Recent landmark detectors, trained on in-the-
wild datasets exhibit excellent robustness against a
head orientation with respect to a camera, varying
illumination and facial expressions. We show that
the landmarks are detected precisely enough to reli-
ably estimate the level of the eye opening. The pro-
posed algorithm therefore estimates the landmark
positions, extracts a single scalar quantity – eye as-
pect ratio (EAR) – characterizing the eye opening in
each frame. Finally, an SVM classiﬁer detects eye
blinks as a pattern of EAR values in a short tempo-
ral window. The simple algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art results on two standard datasets.

1. Introduction

Detecting eye blinks is important for instance in
systems that monitor a human operator vigilance,
e.g. driver drowsiness [5, 13], in systems that warn
a computer user staring at the screen without blink-
ing for a long time to prevent the dry eye and the
computer vision syndromes [17, 7, 8], in human-
computer interfaces that ease communication for dis-
abled people [15], or for anti-spooﬁng protection in
face recognition systems [11].
Existing methods are either active or passive. Ac-
tive methods are reliable but use special hardware,
often expensive and intrusive, e.g. infrared cameras
and illuminators [2], wearable devices, glasses with
a special close-up cameras observing the eyes [10].
While the passive systems rely on a standard remote
camera only.
Many methods have been proposed to automati-
cally detect eye blinks in a video sequence. Several
methods are based on a motion estimation in the eye
region. Typically, the face and eyes are detected by

a Viola-Jones type detector. Next, motion in the eye
area is estimated from optical ﬂow, by sparse track-
ing [7, 8], or by frame-to-frame intensity differenc-
ing and adaptive thresholding. Finally, a decision is
made whether the eyes are or are not covered by eye-
lids [9, 15]. A different approach is to infer the state
of the eye opening from a single image, as e.g. by
correlation matching with open and closed eye tem-
plates [4], a heuristic horizontal or vertical image in-
tensity projection over the eye region [5, 6], a para-
metric model ﬁtting to ﬁnd the eyelids [18], or active
shape models [14].
A major drawback of the previous approaches is
that they usually implicitly impose too strong re-
quirements on the setup, in the sense of a relative
face-camera pose (head orientation), image resolu-
tion, illumination, motion dynamics, etc. Especially
the heuristic methods that use raw image intensity
are likely to be very sensitive despite their real-time
performance.

However nowadays, robust real-time facial land-
mark detectors that capture most of the character-
istic points on a human face image, including eye
corners and eyelids, are available, see Fig. 1. Most
of the state-of-the-art landmark detectors formulate
a regression problem, where a mapping from an im-
age into landmark positions [16] or into other land-
mark parametrization [1] is learned. These mod-
ern landmark detectors are trained on “in-the-wild
datasets” and they are thus robust to varying illu-
mination, various facial expressions, and moderate
non-frontal head rotations. An average error of the
landmark localization of a state-of-the-art detector
is usually below ﬁve percent of the inter-ocular dis-
tance. Recent methods run even signiﬁcantly super
real-time [12].
Therefore, we propose a simple but efﬁcient al-
gorithm to detect eye blinks by using a recent facial
landmark detector. A single scalar quantity that re-
ﬂects a level of the eye opening is derived from the
landmarks. Finally, having a per-frame sequence of
the eye opening estimates, the eye blinks are found
by an SVM classiﬁer that is trained on examples of
blinking and non-blinking patterns.
Facial segmentation model presented in [14] is
similar to the proposed method. However, their sys-
tem is based on active shape models with reported
processing time of about 5 seconds per frame for the
segmentation, and the eye opening signal is normal-
ized by statistics estimated by observing a longer se-
quence. The system is thus usable for ofﬂine pro-
cessing only. The proposed algorithm runs real-time,
since the extra costs of the eye opening from land-
marks and the linear SVM are negligible.
The contributions of the paper are:

1. Ability of two state-of-the-art
landmark de-
tectors [1, 16] to reliably distinguish between
the open and closed eye states is quantita-
tively demonstrated on a challenging in-the-
wild dataset and for various face image resolu-
tions.

2. A novel real-time eye blink detection algorithm
which integrates a landmark detector and a clas-
siﬁer is proposed. The evaluation is done on two
standard datasets [11, 8] achieving state-of-the-
art results.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: The

tion and evaluation is presented in Sec. 3. Finally,
Sec. 4 concludes the paper.

2. Proposed method

The eye blink is a fast closing and reopening of
a human eye. Each individual has a little bit different
pattern of blinks. The pattern differs in the speed of
closing and opening, a degree of squeezing the eye
and in a blink duration. The eye blink lasts approxi-

mately 100-400 ms.
We propose to exploit state-of-the-art facial land-
mark detectors to localize the eyes and eyelid con-
tours. From the landmarks detected in the image,
we derive the eye aspect ratio (EAR) that is used as
an estimate of the eye opening state. Since the per-
frame EAR may not necessarily recognize the eye
blinks correctly, a classiﬁer that takes a larger tem-
poral window of a frame into account is trained.

2.1. Description of features

For every video frame, the eye landmarks are de-
tected. The eye aspect ratio (EAR) between height
and width of the eye is computed.

EAR =

(cid:107)p2 − p6(cid:107) + (cid:107)p3 − p5(cid:107)
2(cid:107)p1 − p4(cid:107)

,

(1)

where p1 , . . . , p6 are the 2D landmark locations, de-
picted in Fig. 1.
The EAR is mostly constant when an eye is open
and is getting close to zero while closing an eye. It
is partially person and head pose insensitive. Aspect
ratio of the open eye has a small variance among indi-
viduals and it is fully invariant to a uniform scaling of
the image and in-plane rotation of the face. Since eye
blinking is performed by both eyes synchronously,
the EAR of both eyes is averaged. An example of
an EAR signal over the video sequence is shown in
Fig. 1, 2, 7.
A similar feature to measure the eye opening was
suggested in [9], but it was derived from the eye seg-
mentation in a binary image.

2.2. Classiﬁcation

It generally does not hold that low value of the
EAR means that a person is blinking. A low value
of the EAR may occur when a subject closes his/her
eyes intentionally for a longer time or performs a fa-
cial expression, yawning, etc., or the EAR captures a
short random ﬂuctuation of the landmarks.
Therefore, we propose a classiﬁer that takes a
larger temporal window of a frame as an input. For
the 30fps videos, we experimentally found that ±6
frames can have a signiﬁcant impact on a blink detec-
tion for a frame where an eye is the most closed when
blinking. Thus, for each frame, a 13-dimensional
feature is gathered by concatenating the EARs of its
±6 neighboring frames.
This is implemented by a linear SVM classiﬁer
(called EAR SVM) trained from manually anno-
tated sequences. Positive examples are collected as

ground-truth blinks, while the negatives are those
that are sampled from parts of the videos where no
blink occurs, with 5 frames spacing and 7 frames
margin from the ground-truth blinks. While testing, a
classiﬁer is executed in a scanning-window fashion.
A 13-dimensional feature is computed and classiﬁed
by EAR SVM for each frame except the beginning
and ending of a video sequence.

3. Experiments

Two types of experiments were carried out: The
experiments that measure accuracy of the landmark
detectors, see Sec. 3.1, and the experiments that eval-
uate performance of the whole eye blink detection
algorithm, see Sec 3.2.

3.1. Accuracy of landmark detectors

To evaluate accuracy of tested landmark detectors,
we used the 300-VW dataset [19]. It is a dataset con-
taining 50 videos where each frame has associated a
precise annotation of facial landmarks. The videos
are “in-the-wild”, mostly recorded from a TV.
The purpose of the following tests is to demon-
strate that recent landmark detectors are particularly
robust and precise in detecting eyes, i.e. the eye-
corners and contour of the eyelids. Therefore we pre-
pared a dataset, a subset of the 300-VW, containing
sample images with both open and closed eyes. More
precisely, having the ground-truth landmark annota-
tion, we sorted the frames for each subject by the eye
aspect ratio (EAR in Eq. (1)) and took 10 frames of
the highest ratio (eyes wide open), 10 frames of the
lowest ratio (mostly eyes tightly shut) and 10 frames
sampled randomly. Thus we collected 1500 images.
Moreover, all the images were later subsampled (suc-
cessively 10 times by factor 0.75) in order to evaluate
accuracy of tested detectors on small face images.
Two state-of-the-art
landmark detectors were
tested: Chehra [1] and Intraface [16]. Both run in
real-time1 . Samples from the dataset are shown in
Fig. 3. Notice that faces are not always frontal to the
camera, the expression is not always neutral, peo-
ple are often emotionally speaking or smiling, etc.
Sometimes people wear glasses, hair may occasion-
ally partially occlude one of the eyes. Both detectors
perform generally well, but the Intraface is more ro-
bust to very small face images, sometimes at impres-
sive extent as shown in Fig. 3.

1 Intraface runs in 50 Hz on a standard laptop.

with landmarks obtained by Chehra [1] and In-
traface [16]. Original images (left) with inter-ocular
distance (IOD) equal to 63 (top) and 53 (bottom) pix-
els. Images subsampled (right) to IOD equal to 6.3
(top) and 17 (bottom).

Quantitatively, the accuracy of the landmark de-
tection for a face image is measured by the average
relative landmark localization error, deﬁned as usu-
ally

where xi is the ground-truth location of landmark i
in the image, ˆxi is an estimated landmark location by
a detector, N is a number of landmarks and normal-
ization factor κ is the inter-ocular distance (IOD), i.e.
Euclidean distance between eye centers in the image.
First, a standard cumulative histogram of the aver-
age relative landmark localization error  was calcu-
lated, see Fig. 4, for a complete set of 49 landmarks
and also for a subset of 12 landmarks of the eyes only,
since these landmarks are used in the proposed eye
blink detector. The results are calculated for all the
original images that have average IOD around 80 px,
and also for all “small” face images (including sub-
sampled ones) having IOD ≤ 50 px. For all land-
marks, Chehra has more occurrences of very small
errors (up to 5 percent of the IOD), but Intraface is
more robust having more occurrences of errors be-
low 10 percent of the IOD. For eye landmarks only,

tion error of all 49 landmarks (top) and 12 landmarks
of the eyes (bottom). The histograms are computed
for original resolution images (solid lines) and a sub-
set of small images (IOD ≤ 50 px).

(cid:80)

the Intraface is always more precise than Chehra. As
already mentioned, the Intraface is much more robust
to small images than Chehra. This behaviour is fur-
ther observed in the following experiment.
Taking a set of all 15k images, we measured a
mean localization error µ as a function of a face im-
age resolution determined by the IOD. More pre-
cisely, µ = 1|S |
j∈S j , i.e. average error over set of
face images S having the IOD in a given range. Re-
sults are shown in Fig. 5. Plots have errorbars of stan-
dard deviation. It is seen that Chehra fails quickly
for images with IOD < 20 px. For larger faces, the
mean error is comparable, although slightly better for
Intraface for the eye landmarks.
The last test is directly related to the eye blink de-
tector. We measured accuracy of EAR as a func-
tion of the IOD. Mean EAR error is deﬁned as a
mean absolute difference between the true and the
estimated EAR. The plots are computed for two sub-
sets: closed/closing (average true ratio 0.05 ± 0.05)

tion of the face image resolution computed for all
landmarks and eye landmarks only.

and open eyes (average true ratio 0.4 ± 0.1). The
error is higher for closed eyes. The reason is prob-
ably that both detectors are more likely to output
open eyes in case of a failure. It is seen that ratio
error for IOD < 20 px causes a major confusion
between open/close eye states for Chehra, neverthe-
less for larger faces the ratio is estimated precisely
enough to ensure a reliable eye blink detection.

3.2. Eye blink detector evaluation

We evaluate on two standard databases with
ground-truth annotations of blinks. The ﬁrst one is
ZJU [11] consisting of 80 short videos of 20 sub-
jects. Each subject has 4 videos: 2 with and 2 without
glasses, 3 videos are frontal and 1 is an upward view.
The 30fps videos are of size 320 × 240 px. An av-
erage video length is 136 frames and contains about
3.6 blinks in average. An average IOD is 57.4 pixels.
In this database, subjects do not perform any notice-
able facial expressions. They look straight into the
camera at close distance, almost do not move, do not

function of the face image resolution. Top:

eyes), and bottom:
images with higher ratio (open
eyes).

either smile nor speak. A ground-truth blink is de-
ﬁned by its beginning frame, peak frame and ending
frame. The second database Eyeblink8 [8] is more
challenging. It consists of 8 long videos of 4 sub-
jects that are smiling, rotating head naturally, cover-
ing face with hands, yawning, drinking and looking
down probably on a keyboard. These videos have
length from 5k to 11k frames, also 30fps, with a res-
olution 640 × 480 pixels and an average IOD 62.9
pixels. They contain about 50 blinks on average per
video. Each frame belonging to a blink is annotated
by half-open or close state of the eyes. We consider
half blinks, which do not achieve the close state, as
full blinks to be consistent with the ZJU.
Besides testing the proposed EAR SVM methods,
that are trained to detect the speciﬁc blink pattern,
we compare with a simple baseline method, which
only thresholds the EAR in Eq. (1) values. The EAR
SVM classiﬁers are tested with both landmark detec-
tors Chehra [1] and Intraface [16].

section with detected blinks. The number of false
negatives is counted as a number of the ground-truth
blinks which do not intersect detected blinks. The
number of false positives is equal to the number of
detected blinks minus the number of true positives
plus a penalty for detecting too long blinks. The
penalty is counted only for detecting blinks twice
longer then an average blink of length A. Every long
blink of length L is counted L
A times as a false posi-
tive. The number of all possibly detectable blinks is
computed as number of frames of a video sequence
divided by subject average blink length following
Drutarovsky and Fogelton [8].
The ZJU database appears relatively easy.
It
mostly holds that every eye closing is an eye blink.
Consequently, the precision-recall curves shown in
Fig. 8a of the EAR thresholding and both EAR SVM
classiﬁers are almost identical. These curves were
calculated by spanning a threshold of the EAR and
SVM output score respectively. All our methods
outperform other detectors [9, 8, 5]. The published
methods presented the precision and the recall for a
single operation point only, not the precision-recall
curve. See Fig. 8a for comparison.
The precision-recall curves in Fig. 8b shows eval-
uation on the Eyeblink8 database. We observe that in
this challenging database the EAR thresholding lags
behind both EAR SVM classiﬁers. The thresholding
fails when a subject smiles (has narrowed eyes - see
an example in Fig. 7), has a side view or when the
subject closes his/her eyes for a time longer than a
blink duration. Both SVM detectors performs much
better, the Intraface detector based SVM is even a
little better than the Chehra SVM. Both EAR SVM
detectors outperform the method by Drutarovsky and
Fogelton [8] by a signiﬁcant margin.
Finally, we measured a dependence of the whole
blink detector accuracy on the average IOD over the
dataset. Every frame of the ZJU database was sub-
sampled to 90%, 80%, ..., 10% of its original reso-
lution. Both Chehra-SVM and Intraface-SVM were
used for evaluation. For each resolution, the area un-
der the precision-recall curve (AUC) was computed.
The result is shown in Fig. 9. We can see that with
Chehra landmarks the accuracy remains very high
until average IOD is about 30 px. The detector fails
on images with the IOD < 20 px. Intraface land-
marks are much better in low resolutions. This con-
ﬁrms our previous study on the accuracy of land-
marks in Sec. 3.1.

The experiment with EAR SVM is done in a cross-
dataset fashion. It means that the SVM classiﬁer is
trained on the Eyeblink8 and tested on the ZJU and
vice versa.
To evaluate detector accuracy, predicted blinks are
compared with the ground-truth blinks. The number
of true positives is determined as a number of the
ground-truth blinks which have a non-empty inter-

4. Conclusion

A real-time eye blink detection algorithm was
presented. We quantitatively demonstrated that
regression-based facial landmark detectors are pre-
cise enough to reliably estimate a level of eye open-
ness. While they are robust to low image quality (low
image resolution in a large extent) and in-the-wild

phenomena as non-frontality, bad illumination, facial
expressions, etc.
State-of-the-art on two standard datasets was
achieved using the robust landmark detector fol-
lowed by a simple eye blink detection based on the
SVM. The algorithm runs in real-time, since the ad-
ditional computational costs for the eye blink detec-
tion are negligible besides the real-time landmark de-
tectors.
The proposed SVM method that uses a temporal
window of the eye aspect ratio (EAR), outperforms
the EAR thresholding. On the other hand, the thresh-
olding is usable as a single image classiﬁer to detect
the eye state, in case that a longer sequence is not
available.
We see a limitation that a ﬁxed blink duration for
all subjects was assumed, although everyone’s blink
lasts differently. The results could be improved by an
adaptive approach. Another limitation is in the eye
opening estimate. While EAR is estimated from a 2D
image, it is fairly insensitive to a head orientation, but
may lose discriminability for out of plane rotations.
A solution might be to deﬁne the EAR in 3D. There
are landmark detectors that estimate a 3D pose (po-
sition and orientation) of a 3D model of landmarks,
e.g. [1, 3].
